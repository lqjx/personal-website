        <p class="text-lg">
            I go by the pseudonym "daydream". I've been into programming since I was a child, which was when I was about 10 years old.
            My brother introduced me to simple HTML and CSS. Just plain HTML and CSS. No JavaScript (Bad language btw), no other languages, nothing.<br><br>

            After some time learning and playing around with websites,  I came up with some <span class="font-bold italic">l33t haxxor skid program</span> ideas.
            One of these was a <span class="font-bold">Minecraft OP Hack</span> made in <span class="font-bold">Visual Basic</span>. Yeah, really. I made this.
            It was basically a phishing tool.
            <br><br>

            Fast forward until now, I visited a school to learn about <span class="font-bold">
            Electrical Engineering, Embedded C Programming, Databases, Game Development in Python, Networking Technology
        </span>
            and immensely improved my programming skills in various languages like:<br>
            <span class="font-bold">HTML, CSS, JS, SQL, C++ </span>and the basics of <span class="font-bold">ASM</span>.<br><br>

            I learned about so many topics in the past and decided to stick to experimenting and working on various things in C++ and Web Development.
            Occasionally, I reverse engineer malware and crack my favorite programs, for the purpose of studying them.
